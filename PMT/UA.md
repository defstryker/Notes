## Components of UA testing
> 1. Surveys
> 2. Resources: survey-monkey
> 3. page 334 from the textbook
> 4. End users **only** test the business process.

### Surveys
- use 3 categories of check lists/survey
- functionality, usability, core functionality
- better have a higher number of testing users (the median can answer questions better). 20 is a good number.
- Try to perform a comparative study between existing systems and our product.
- ..

Usability testing includes the following five components:

1. **Learn-ability**: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design?
2. **Efficiency**: How fast can experienced users accomplish tasks?
3. **Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, does the user remember enough to use it effectively the next time, or does the user have to start over again learning everything?
4. **Errors**: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors and how easily can they recover from the errors?
5. **Satisfaction**: How much does the user like using the system?
