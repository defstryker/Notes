# Procurement and Costs Plan
### Main points
1. _Talking about implementation of the system._
2.  _make-buy-lease_
3. _table to decide make/buy/lease by comparison of a few PaaS or SaaS for hosting a python/Django wsgi application._
4. _Presentation is 80% value preposition. Sell the product, toot its glory. Gloria perpetua._

| Providers | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| _(SaaS)_ RedHat OpenShift | _free_; based on various levels of pricing. The bronze plan provides a pay-as-you-go plan structure which is recommended for the initial period of use for the system. As needed can upgrade to the gold plan for more resources based on the amount of usage and view count. |
| _(SaaS)_ Heroku | _starting from $25/month_; The standard package is recommended as the other cheaper plans provided have very little resources for efficient usage of system even in earlier stages. |
| _(PaaS)_ Digital Ocean | _Starts from \$5/month_; The \$20 package is recommended for initial stages but as the usage climbs can upgrade seamlessly to the higher tiers. This is a _Platform as a Service_ and hence requires additional setup for installing and configuring a server (nginx/tornado/autobahn-twisted) and deploying the system. |
